# Space Race
Do you love arcade games? Or are you old enough to see such games?

You may have heard of [Atari's Space Race game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_Race_(video_game)) or played similar games involving asteroids or enemies. In those games, you aim to reach the top of the screen - if asteroids hit you, you must start from the beginning. In other variations, you can earn scores by shooting the asteroids or enemies, and you lose your life or health if they hit you.

My first game project is a variation of Space Race, where you shoot the enemies to gain points. If you let the enemy go past you, you lose your points. If an enemy hits you, you lose health - and the game is over once your health becomes zero. Simple, right?

You can also play with your friends, as this game supports up to 4 players (1-4)!
